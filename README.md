TOP - Food Safety Consulting Website

First website from The Odin Project!

I wanted to make a website in the event I am able to consult for food safety services one day. I plan to build off this site with more features, and one day spin off into database courses to replace my current professional database. 

In the future I would like to add CSS animations where possible, use java to do a slideshow of more spoofed reviews etc, and flush out the site in general and possibly add email contact submission and a portfolio / resume page.

Review Items:

DevTools are a lifesaver, and show whether the flexbox worked, or whether the CSS style was being contradicted. Extremely useful when trying to understand flexbox. 

Using flexbox! I will need to review this frequently. Its great for placement but I really need to visualize alignment with items, and which items are actually flex items, or flex containers with items inside, even when they overlap!

When importing fonts from google, do not forget to add all weights, sizes to the copied CSS.

Using CSS, make enough classes. In addition we can apparently universally set attributes or use CASS to organize CSS. To start, i will be trying to separate by sections, fonts and background colors, and unique items. This will most likely get refined as I learn more.
